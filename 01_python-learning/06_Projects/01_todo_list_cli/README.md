# Project 1: Command-Line To-Do List App

This project is a simple but functional to-do list application that runs entirely in your command line. It demonstrates several core Python concepts:

-   **Functions:** The code is organized into clear, reusable functions.
-   **Lists:** The to-do tasks are managed in a Python list.
-   **File I/O:** Tasks are saved to a `tasks.txt` file so your data persists between sessions.
-   **Loops:** The main application runs in a `while` loop to continuously ask for user input.
-   **Conditionals:** `if/elif/else` statements are used to handle the user's menu choices.
-   **Error Handling:** A `try...except` block is used to handle invalid user input gracefully.

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to this directory in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd 06_Projects/01_todo_list_cli
    ```
2.  Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3.  Follow the on-screen menu to add, view, or remove tasks. Your tasks will be saved automatically in a `tasks.txt` file in this directory.
