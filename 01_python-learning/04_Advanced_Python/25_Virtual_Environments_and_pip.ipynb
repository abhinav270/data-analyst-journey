    "**Goal:** Learn the best practices for managing project dependencies to ensure your projects are isolated and reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the most important practical skills for any Python developer. A **virtual environment** is an isolated Python environment that allows you to manage dependencies for a specific project separately from other projects and the global Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers:\n",
    "1.  **Why Use Virtual Environments?**\n",
    "2.  **Creating a Virtual Environment (`venv`).**\n",
    "3.  **Activating and Deactivating.**\n",

    "### 1. Why Use Virtual Environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have two projects:\n",
    "- **Project A** requires version 1.0 of a library (e.g., `requests==1.0`).\n",
    "- **Project B** requires version 2.0 of the same library (`requests==2.0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you install these libraries globally, you can't have both versions at the same time. One project will inevitably break. Virtual environments solve this by creating a self-contained directory for each project that includes a copy of the Python interpreter and its own set of installed packages."
