    "A **database** is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. At its core, a database is designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relational vs. NoSQL\n",
    "- **Relational Databases (like SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL):** Organize data into one or more **tables**. Each table consists of **rows** and **columns**. The relationships between tables are defined, which is why they are called 'relational'. They use SQL (Structured Query Language).\n",
    "- **NoSQL Databases (like MongoDB, Redis):** Use a variety of other models, such as key-value, document, or graph formats. They are more flexible but can be less structured. We will be focusing on relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Terminology\n",
    "- **Table:** A collection of related data held in a table format within a database. (e.g., a `users` table).\n",
    "- **Column (or Field):** A vertical entity in a table that contains all information of one specific type. (e.g., an `age` column).\n",
    "- **Row (or Record):** A horizontal entity in a table, representing a single data item. (e.g., a single user's information).\n",
    "- **Primary Key:** A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain UNIQUE values and cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "- **Foreign Key:** A key used to link two tables together. It's a field in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table."

    "- **DQL (Data Query Language):** Used to query the database. The main command is `SELECT`.\n",
    "- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Used to define the database schema. Commands include `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`.\n",
    "- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Used for adding, deleting, and modifying data. Commands include `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.\n",
    "- **DCL (Data Control Language):** Used for managing database security. Commands include `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.\n",
    "- **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Used to manage transactions. Commands include `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`."

    "- **Built into Python:** The `sqlite3` module is part of Python's standard library, so there's nothing extra to install.\n",
