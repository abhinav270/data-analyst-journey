    "- **Control Group:** A group that does not receive the treatment or intervention. They provide a baseline to compare against.\n",
    "- **Treatment Group:** The group that receives the treatment.\n",
    "- **Random Assignment:** Subjects are randomly assigned to either the control or treatment group. This is the most critical step. Randomization helps ensure that, on average, the two groups are identical in every way *except* for the treatment. This minimizes the effect of confounding variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** To test a new drug, you would randomly assign participants to receive either the new drug (treatment) or a placebo (control). By comparing the outcomes, you can isolate the effect of the drug itself."
