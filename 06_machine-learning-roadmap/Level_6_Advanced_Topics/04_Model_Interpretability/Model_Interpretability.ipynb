    "LIME provides local interpretability. For a single prediction, it works by creating a small, perturbed dataset around the data point and training a simple, interpretable model (like a linear model) on this small dataset. The explanations from this simple model are then used to explain the complex model's prediction for that single data point."

    "SHAP is a game theory approach to explaining the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. SHAP values tell you how much each feature contributed to pushing the model's prediction away from the base value (the average prediction over the training set)."
