    "To properly evaluate a machine learning model, we need to test it on data it has never seen before. A simple `train_test_split` is good, but if we use the test set to tune our model's hyperparameters, we will 'leak' information from the test set into our model, and our final evaluation will be overly optimistic.\n",

    "- **Training Set**: Used to train the model's parameters.\n",
    "- **Validation Set**: Used to tune the model's hyperparameters (e.g., the 'k' in k-NN, or 'max_depth' in a Decision Tree).\n",
    "- **Test Set**: Held back until the very end. Used only once to get a final, unbiased measure of the chosen model's performance."
