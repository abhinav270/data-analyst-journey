# Machine Learning Learning Roadmap: From Scratch to Advanced

Welcome to the structured Machine Learning (ML) learning roadmap! This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that will guide you from the absolute basics to advanced topics in machine learning.

## Roadmap Structure

The learning path is divided into several levels. Each level has its own directory, and within each level, every major concept or algorithm has its own dedicated sub-folder containing a focused notebook. This granular structure allows you to study topics individually.

*   **Level 0: Prerequisites**
*   **Level 1: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
*   **Level 2: Supervised Learning**
*   **Level 3: Unsupervised Learning**
*   **Level 4: Reinforcement Learning**
*   **Level 5: Model Selection & Hyperparameter Tuning**
*   **Level 6: Advanced Topics & Best Practices**
*   **Level 7: Real-World Projects**

## How to Use This Repository

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate into the directory for the level and topic you want to study (e.g., `Level_2_Supervised_Learning/Linear_Regression/`).
3.  Open the Jupyter notebook and follow along.

Let's get started!
